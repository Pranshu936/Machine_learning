1. Worst airline experience ever. Delayed flight and lost baggage!
2. Totally disappointed with United Airlines, never flying again.
3. Horrible customer service. They kept us waiting for hours.
4. Missed my connection because of the flight delay. So frustrating!
5. The crew was rude and the plane was dirty. Very poor service.
